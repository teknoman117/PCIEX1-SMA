# PCIEX1-SMA

Adapts a PCIe x1 slot into 6 SMA connectors (REFCLK, TX, and RX differential pairs), and a pin header for SMBUS and the PERST signal. This is intended to be the one of the lowest cost SMA adapter boards for PCIe x1.

Imagined use case is adapting the Crosslink-NX Evaluation Board into a PCIe capable board by installing the missing SMA connectors and providing an adapter board to an actual PCIe connector.
